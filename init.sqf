For each aector status, the number show you current capture status. If it is equal to the maximum capture time (default 30), the sector belongs to OPFOR. If it is equal 0, it belongs to BLUFOR. You can also see x seconds to recap. This is the time it takes to end the mission after all CPs have been captured by BLUFOR. If BLUFOR holds all CPs and time to recap drops to 0, the mission ends. This timer does not reset. You can also see time until the mission ends."]];
